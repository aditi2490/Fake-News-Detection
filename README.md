# Fake News Detector

## Introduction

The news medium has evolved into a means of informing people about what is going on in the world. So far people have always believed whatever they hear in the news to be true. However, there have been instances where news outlets have admitted that their reporting was inaccurate. At times, some news have a significant impact not only on the people or the government, but also on the economy. Depending on the people's emotions and the political situation, a single piece of news can cause the situation to change drastically. Hence, it is now critical to distinguish between the fake and the true news. The problem has been taken over and resolved with the assistance of Natural Language Processing tools, which help us in determining whether a given news is fake or true based on the context.

Fake news can come from a variety of sources and be spread across multiple platforms. One of the characteristics of fake news is that the content appears to be produced by credible news outlets which causes the confusion and makes it more difficult for news consumers to determine what is true.

## Objective

To classify the news from the dataset to fake or true news
Extensive EDA of news
Selecting and building a powerful model for classification
Libraries used:-
Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NLTK, Sklearn, WordCloud .

## Fake-News-Detection-App

Fake news detection using Machine Learning algorithms and Flask Framework. Enter your text or generate a random one from our dataset to try it. The text is first preprocessed and transformed as a vector. Then, the transformed vector is feeded to the trained model to be classified as fake or real.
